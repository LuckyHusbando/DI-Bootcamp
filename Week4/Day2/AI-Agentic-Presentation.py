#Alain Prasquier's Presentation - AI Agentic - How is it entering the business space? - 12/08/2025

#What is an AI Agent?

#3 principles - Autonomous, Perception, Reasoning

#Independent behavior and judgment, reasoning ability, able to perceive information presented to it and make judgments and actions.

#Example bots: Customer Support, Sales Outreach, Research Assistant, Code review agent, Travel organizer, HR onboard coach, (etc)

#Creating agents is actually very easy - ChatGPT 5.0 now has the ability to have an agent do a task in the background while a human user works.

#Anything with intensive administrative tasks can now be done by sophisticated AI. 

#General belief at present: 15-50% of business tasks will be performed by AI agents. 

#95% of Generative AI projects never reach production!!!

#Disruptive Innovation with AI:
#1. No oversight!
#2. No business stakeholders (at present)
#3. Distruption -instead- of productivity
#4. Significant Risk exposure - The "non-deterministic" conundrum. 

#Most tasks & processes - 'IF' > 'THEN' > 'ELSE'

#Mission - Enable business stakeholders to operate mission-critical AI agents with confidence.
#Vision - Power the Future of Work for hyper-productivity. 

#AI-Agent Tooling marketing is not yet mature

#Path to AI Agent Adoption

#1. Custom-built Agents (Mission Critical - Core/proprietary processes, custom workflows, private/confidential/regulated activities)
#2. AaaS (Agents as a Service) (Off-the-shelf AI Agent) (Standardize workflows of all aspects of business)
#3. AI Extensions (enhancing existing software)
