The values are categorical labels, which makes it a qualitative column.\n","\n","#Exercise 5\n","\n","# Based on the analysis of the clean_dataset.csv file, here are the key findings for the 'Age' and 'Income' columns.\n","\n","# Quantitative Column Analysis\n","# Age: The mean age of the applicants is approximately 31.51 years. The median and mode are both 28.46, indicating that the data is skewed to the right. This means that while most applicants are around their late 20s, there are a few older applicants that pull the average age higher.\n","\n","# Income: The mean income is approximately $1017.39. However, the median is only $5.00, and the mode is $0.00. This large discrepancy suggests that the income data is highly skewed, with a majority of applicants having very little to no reported income, while a few have extremely high incomes, which pulls the average up.\n","\n","# Data Visualization\n","# The following plots provide a visual representation of the distributions for the 'Age' and 'Income' columns.\n","\n","# Age Distribution\n","# The histogram for Age shows a right-skewed distribution. The highest frequency of applicants falls within the 20-30 age range, with frequencies decreasing as age increases. This confirms our statistical findings that the majority of applicants are relatively young.\n","\n","# Income Distribution\n","# The histogram for Income shows a strong concentration of applicants with an income of $0.00, which is consistent with the mode. A large number of applicants also have low incomes, while there are a few outliers with very high incomes. This confirms the large skewness indicated by the statistical measures.\n","\n","#Exercise 6\n","\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","# Load the dataset\n","df_sleep = pd.read_csv('How Much Sleep Do Americans.zip/How Much Sleep Do Americans/Time Americans Spend Sleeping.csv')\n","\n","# Display the first few rows and column information\n","print(\"First five rows of the dataset:\")\n","print(df_sleep.head())\n","print(\"\\nColumn information:\")\n","df_sleep.info()\n","\n","# Based on the structure of the dataset, several columns are particularly interesting for specific types of analysis:\n","\n","# 1. Trend Analysis\n","# Columns: Year and Avg hrs per day sleeping\n","\n","# Reasoning: The Year column represents a timeline, while Avg hrs per day sleeping is a quantitative measure of the average amount of sleep. By plotting Avg hrs per day sleeping against Year, you can visualize and analyze the trends in sleep patterns among Americans over time. This could reveal whether the average sleep duration has increased, decreased, or remained stable.\n","\n","# 2. Group Comparison\n","# Columns: Age Group, Sex, and Avg hrs per day sleeping\n","\n","# Reasoning: The Age Group and Sex columns are qualitative categories that allow you to compare sleep patterns across different demographics. You can use these columns to:\n","\n","# Compare the average hours of sleep between males and females (Sex).\n","\n","# Analyze how sleep duration varies across different age groups (Age Group), such as \"15 to 24 years\" versus \"65 years and over.\"\n","\n","# Conduct a more detailed comparison by grouping the data by both Age Group and Sex to see if there are unique sleep patterns within specific demographic segments."]}]}
