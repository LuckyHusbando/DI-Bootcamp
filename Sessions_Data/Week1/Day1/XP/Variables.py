#naming variables best practices

my_age = 35
my_name = "XXX"

# input() function = a way of getting "user" input.

user_name = input("What\'s your name?")
print(user_name)

#VERY IMPORTANT INFO ABOUT INPUT: The value is by default a STRING!

user_age = (input("What's your age?"))
print(f'In 123879 years you will be {int(user_age) + 123789} years old')

# f' string = string that is formated to be more readable.

# Conditional statements add logic to any programming language (IF / THEN)
