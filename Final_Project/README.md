## 🎯 Objective
To build a robust data architecture and visualization suite that identifies which genres dominated specific hardware platforms during the industry's critical transition from the **7th generation** (PS3, Xbox 360, Wii) to the **8th generation** (PS4, Xbox One, Switch).

---

## 🏗 Phase 1: Data Architecture & SQL Foundation
*Transforming raw metadata into a high-performance analytical engine.*

### Database Schema Design
We implement a **Star Schema** to optimize for complex analytical queries across 10+ years of sales records.

* **Fact Table:** `Sales` (Global, NA, EU, JP, Other)
* **Dimensions:** `Platform`, `Genre`, `Publisher`, `Release_Date`

### SQL Query Development & Validation
* **Performance:** Optimized views aggregate sales data for the 2008–2018 window.
* **Data Integrity:** Implemented `COALESCE` and strict `FOREIGN KEY` constraints to handle legacy null values and ensure cross-platform title consistency.

---

## 🐍 Phase 2: Python Processing & Market Modeling
*The "Analytical Layer" utilizing statistical normalization and trend detection.*

### Market Growth Modeling
We calculate the **Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)** to understand the pace of industry expansion:

$$CAGR = \left( \frac{V_{final}}{V_{begin}} \right)^{\frac{1}{t}} - 1$$

*Where $V_{begin}$ (2008) and $V_{final}$ (2018) represent the total market valuation across $t=10$ years.*

### Trend Identification Logic
* **Generation Clustering:** Automating the grouping of platforms into generational cohorts.
* **Normalization:** Comparing "Evergreen" genres (e.g., Sports, which maintained a consistent ~27% market share) against "Trend" surges (e.g., Shooters peaking in 2015-2018).

---

## 🎨 Phase 3: Tableau Visualization & Strategic Reporting
*Translating 10 years of data into interactive narratives for stakeholders.*

### Dashboard Deliverables
1.  **The Platform Heatmap:** A visual matrix identifying "Niche" vs. "Mass Market" pairings (e.g., the dominance of RPGs on Nintendo handhelds vs. Shooters on Xbox).
2.  **Market Share Race Chart:** An animated transition showing how the **Action** genre maintained dominance while **Battle Royale/Shooters** disrupted the landscape post-2015.
