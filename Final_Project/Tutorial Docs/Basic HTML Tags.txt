==Understanding Basic HTML Tags==

Before we start scraping, it helps to understand what each common HTML tag represents:

<html>: The root element that contains all HTML content.
<head>: Metadata about the page (like its title or linked stylesheets).
<title>: The title of the page, usually shown in the browser tab.
<body>: The main content of the webpage that users see.
<h1>, <h2>, ... <h6>: Headings, where <h1> is the highest level.
<p>: Paragraph of text.
<ul>: Unordered list (bulleted).
<ol>: Ordered list (numbered).
<li>: List item inside <ul> or <ol>.
<div>: A division or section of the page, often used as a container.
<strong>: Displays bold text, often used to emphasize content.
